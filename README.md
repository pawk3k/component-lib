# Component library

It's a repository to contain building blocks for an application.
It's is not universal and it's not intended to be.

### Goals of this project
I believe that this project is a good starting point for a new component library.
Don't get to deep with complex components and this repository intend is to contain some atomic components 
like buttons , text inputs , modals, not whole user experiences or pages to keep it simple.

- Keep our codebase DRY by writing reusable components
- Have a quick way to view and demo our components and their behavior
- Empower designers and product to give direct feedback on component behavior
- Have a way to share components in projects and teams

### Utils 
Utils are saved inside the `scripts` folder 
- `crete-component`: create a component and a story for it so you don't have to do it yourself 

### Additional information
